    <p>Welcome to my homepage. Everything you see was custom designed and coded by myself. If you're interested in a custom homepage, please visit the <a href="https://rosehinata.github.io/RoseHinataNeon/requests.html">Requests</a> tab.</p>
    <p>Use the navigation buttons placed above this panel to look around. Everything is <b>self-explanatory</b> and all the information you <i>might</i> be looking for is posted on my page already.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in my badges, please look at the <a href="https://rosehinata.github.io/RoseHinataNeon/badges.html">Badges</a> tab before sending me a message.</p>
    <p>If you have any other questions for me, <b>READ THE <a href="https://rosehinata.github.io/RoseHinataNeon/faq.html">FAQ</a> TAB BEFORE MESSAGING ME!</b> If you message me asking a question I have already answered, I will disregard your message. Ways to contact me can be found in the <a href="https://rosehinata.github.io/RoseHinataNeon/contact.html">Contact</a> tab. However, I do not give out any of my personal social media so basically the only way of contacting me is through IMVU.</p>
        <p>I am on IMVU every day, so you can expect a response within 24 hours.</p>
    <p><i>If you would like to donate</i>, you can do so via my PayPal by clicking <a href="https://paypal.me/pools/c/8A5hCKINTk">here!</a> All proceeds go to making badges here at IMVU! <b>Thank you for all your love and support!</b>
