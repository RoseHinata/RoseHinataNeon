    <h1>Requests</h1>
    <center>Requests: <h>OPEN</h></center>
    <p>As someone who is pursuing a degree in <i>Graphics Design</i>, I have a wide range of media that I can draw/design. So, I am open to any requests. I can design, draw, and code. I have drawn many images in several different styles, some traditional art and mostly digital art. I have coded many, <b>many</b> homepages and I have designed them all from scratch. I like to work on badges because I find pixeling to be fun. I have drawn images for artists to promote their music or their businesses, I used to be an apprentice for a tattoo shop and a few of my drawings have been tattooed on people. I don't remember them all, but I remember one was a former boss and my mom! Anywho, the point is I have a lot of experience so I am open to a lot of ideas.</p>
    <p>If you want an advertisement card, maybe for your shop or maybe you want a custom and unique default picture, <b>come and talk to me!</b> I happily take credits as a payment and we will negotiate prices to what seems fair for both parties (you and me).</p>
    <p><i>If you are interested in requesting from me!!!</i> Please make sure to be as detailed as possible about what you want. Do not be shy, express those ideas in your head and let me help you achieve them! And don't feel bad if you are struggling or don't have much to say about what you want--I will not turn you away. I will do what I can to help!</p>
    <p>I take requests for <u>anything.</u> Literally. But, to sum it up short to give you the general idea, I take requests for: <i>badges, homepages, advertisements, product pages, default pictures, and more!</i> I am just a new artist ready to make a name for myself, so I'm happy to tackle any project!</p>
