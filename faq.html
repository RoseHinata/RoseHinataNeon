    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Here you can find the answers to all your questions! Well, maybe most of your questions. If you don't see your question up listed below, feel free to <b>message</b> me.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Will you teach me how to code/design/draw?</b></br>
Sorry, I am a lot of things but a teacher is not one. Also, I work part time and I have classes. During the summer on my breaks, I get too busy and distracted with my projects that I just don't want to make time for a student.</p></br></br>
<p><b>What programs do you use?</b></br>
I use <i>GIMP, Visual Studio Code, and Paint Tool Sai.</i> I am starting to use the program <i>Krita</i> for my drawings.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Do you take free requests?</b></br>
No. I'm sorry, but I'm not a charity.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Do you take IMVU product requests?</b></br>
No, I'm not as interested in 3D developing as I am 2D designing.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Why won't you accept my friend request?</b></br>
I don't accept friend requests from people I don't know.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Will you be my Hinata?</b></br>
As much as this question makes me want to barf, absolutely not.</p></br></br>
