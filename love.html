    <h1>Nate</h1>
    <h2>20.12.03</h2>
    <p>Before I met you, I was bitter and was on the verge of losing all faith in love. I hated the world, I had isolated myself completely from everyone and then a piece of me wanted to come back to IMVU. The plan of returning to IMVU was to make friends, force myself out of my dark world and to get back to my roots. You helped me with that, you have helped me in so many ways. Parts of me are still bitter from time to time, however it has been easier to find the <b>strength</b> within me to keep moving forward. Whereas in my past, I would close up and want to give up. You are my Naruto, the man who inspired me to keep trying and not to lose faith in the world.</p>
    <p>Some days I feel you may be too good for me, so I keep striving to be more and to be better. Though you would say I am fine the way I am now, I will never stop trying to put in all my effort so that I can continue by your side. I am <i>that woman</i> who watched you from the sideline, I saw your kind heart behind the screen and I wanted to know more. Somehow, you noticed me and I will never forget how lucky and excited I felt in those beginning moments. I would get so excited when you would flirt with me that I would burry my face into a pillow and squeal. As embarrassing as that might be, that is how I was.</p>
    <p>Now, you are apart of my every day. I think about you all the time, still. I remember last year before I knew you, I looked up at the clouds and thought is there really a man out there who can compliment me? A man who can appreciate me for who I am? And if so, what does he look like and what is he doing right now? Little did I know that a few months after asking that question, I met you. People could say you <i>hung the moon</i>, but for me you hung the <b>galaxy.</b> You are a gift that was given to me by the universe and I cherish that.</p>
    <p>I love you.</p>
