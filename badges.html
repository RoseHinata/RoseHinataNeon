    <h1>Badges</h1>
    <p>If you're interested in buying my badges, please <b>read</b> the information here before making your purchase. You may send the credits to me if you wish or you can purchase the stickers I have posted in my <a href="https://www.imvu.com/shop/web_search.php?manufacturers_id=260022361" target="_blank">Catalog</a>. IMVU has a limit to how many credits a person can send monthly, so this alternative way of buying my badges works!</p>
    <p><h>DO NOT BUY THE STICKERS WITH PROMO CREDITS!</h> If you do buy the stickers, please do not purchase them with promo credits as I will not make the intended profit. If you do purchase the stickers with promo credits, I apologize in advance, but you <u>will not receive the badge!</u></p>
    <p>You may notice that the badges are a little more expensive than advertised. Let me explain this: When creators submit a sticker into the catalog, they are charged 93 credits for a submission fee and 182 credits for a derivation fee. Along with that, there is a retail markup that ranges in price. So the added credits does not go to me, it goes to IMVU. I am still only making a profit of the indicated price as advertised on the badges!</p>
    <p>When you purchase a badge, please <b>message me</b> about which badge(s) you have purchased and I will <i>verify</i> the purchase on my end. I will respond to you so that you know I have received your message and once verified, I will grant you the badge(s). Please allow me <b>24 hours</b> to respond and grant you your badge. If there is any problem, I will reach out to you.</p>
    <p><i>Below</i> you will find all of my badges that are for sale, along with links to the stickers in the catalog. Any deals or additional information can be found right beside the badge icon! Any new badges that I add will be posted in the update panel to the left of this panel, and also displayed below the music panel.</p>
    <p>I do take inquiries for future badges, so if there is a character badge you would like to see, feel free to send me a message!</p>
    <p>That is all, thank you for your time!</p>
