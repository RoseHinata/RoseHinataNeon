    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p><i>Hello.</i> I am RoseHinata. My username is a combination of two of my favorite girls, Rose Tyler and Hinata Hyuuga. I am a <b>Graphics Design</b> major at my hometown university. I like to draw, create, code, and design. Once upon a time, I was on IMVU years ago. I came back in August of last year and I am here to <u>unleash my creativity.</u> On IMVU, I am not the biggest socialite. In general, I am not a socialite. A lot of people assume I am a bitch or that I am rude, however I view it as I am cautious and socially awkward. However, your perception of me is your own free will.</p>
    <p>A lot of my approach to social interactions are business-oriented. I come off professional, uptight, and lacking personality. The real me is someone that not a lot of people get to experience and that is my own doing. I am a picky person in every aspect of my life and that includes the people I interact with. I hate confrontation and I avoid it if possible. I do not like to be the center of attention so I try hard to stay out of the limelight.</p>
    <p>I have <h>Epilepsy</h> and I am being tested for <i>Autism</i>. These factors contribute to my awkwardness and I live in my own world. I'm an <b>anomaly</b> and I take pride in it.</p>
    <p>I have been designing since I was ten years old, everything I have learned is self-taught. I took a couple of Web Design courses at my university a few semesters back, but what I was taught in class I had already known about. My favorite styles of drawing are, you guessed it, anime but also semi-realism. I have a new found love for patterns and geometric designs. I respect all forms of art, because to me, you're not a true artist if you do not respect every form of art. Though there are styles of art I am not fond of, I can still see the beauty in every work of art ranging from a painting to the tallest skyscraper in the world.</p>
